# Release Process

This document describes the release process for dev-cli-tools.

## Pre-Release Checklis

Before creating a release, ensure all the following items are completed:

### 1. Version Updates
Run the pre-release check to verify version consistency:
```bash
./tests/pre-release-check.sh
```

The script checks:
- [x] Script header version (`# Version: X.X.X` in src/dev)
- [x] Script VERSION variable (`VERSION="X.X.X"` in src/dev)
- [x] README.md version badge
- [x] CHANGELOG.md entry for the new version
- [x] Documentation files exis
- [x] Git working directory status

### 2. Manual Verification
- [ ] Test the script functionality manually
- [ ] Verify all recent bugfixes work as expected
- [ ] Check that no breaking changes were introduced
- [ ] Review CHANGELOG.md for completeness

### 3. Git State
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Working directory clean
- [ ] On main/master branch

## Release Steps

### 1. Automated Release (Recommended)
```bash
# Run pre-release check
./tests/pre-release-check.sh

# If check passes, create release
./scripts/create-release.sh
```

### 2. Manual Release
```bash
# 1. Get current version
VERSION=$(grep '^VERSION=' src/dev | cut -d'"' -f2)

# 2. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v${VERSION}"

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag -a "v${VERSION}" -m "Release v${VERSION}"
git push origin main
git push origin "v${VERSION}"

# 4. Create GitHub release (manual via web interface)
```

## Version Numbering

This project follows Semantic Versioning (semver.org):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** forma
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

## Release Types

### Patch Release (X.X.Y+1)
For bug fixes and small improvements:
- Typo fixes
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements (without API changes)

### Minor Release (X.Y+1.0)
For new features that are backwards compatible:
- New commands
- New configuration options
- Enhanced existing functionality

### Major Release (X+1.0.0)
For breaking changes:
- Removed commands or options
- Changed command behavior
- New system requirements

## Post-Release

After creating a release:

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Announce the release** in relevant channels
3. **Monitor for issues** from users
4. **Prepare hotfixes** if critical issues are found

## Hotfix Process

For critical issues in released versions:

1. Create hotfix branch from release tag
2. Apply minimal fix
3. Update version to next patch (e.g., 1.3.5 â†’ 1.3.6)
4. Update CHANGELOG.md
5. Create new release
6. Merge hotfix back to main branch

## Files That Must Be Updated for Each Release

1. **src/dev** (2 locations):
   - Line ~9: `# Version: X.X.X`
   - Line ~15: `VERSION="X.X.X"`

2. **README.md**:
   - Version badge: `version-X.X.X`

3. **CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Add new version entry at the top
   - Include date in format: `## [X.X.X] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - List all changes under appropriate categories (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
   - For major releases, include performance metrics and migration notes

## Validation

Always run the pre-release check before creating a release:
```bash
./tests/pre-release-check.sh
```

This ensures version consistency across all files and prevents common release errors.
